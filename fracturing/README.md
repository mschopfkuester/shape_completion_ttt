# data-prep

Make sure you've created and activated the python virtual environment. Then install pymesh.
```
./install_pymesh.sh
```

To generate fractured shapes from scratch, download shapenet from https://shapenet.org/. Extract the data into a directory, e.g. "/path/to/above/ShapeNet".

Almost all scripts require that the following environment variable be set to the directory above ShapeNet.
```
export DATADIR="/path/to/above/ShapeNet"
```

## Data preparation
Fracturing is done in several steps:

1) Waterproof meshes.
2) Normalize meshes. 
3) Fracture meshes. 
4) Compute sample points.
5) Compute SDF values. 
6) Compute spline breaks. 
7) Compute voxels. (for baselines)
8) Compute OCC values. (for baselines)

The `scripts/fracture.sh` takes an integer corresponding to one of the above processes.

NOTE: waterproofing cannot be done on a PC that does not have a display.

This readme will demo the data processing pipeline for the mugs dataset from shapenet. We assume you've downloaded shapenet to:
```
$DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2
```

To perform a single step of data processing use the `scripts/fracture.sh` script. The script takes 4 arguments:
- Path to the directory containing shapenet data
- Path to a .json train/test split file (will be created if does not exist)
- Operation (int from 1 to 8, corresponding to the above list)
- Number of breaks

We provide a wrapper, `scripts/run.sh`, to execute all preprocessing steps in order. The following will perform all preprocessing steps in order, fracturing each object 1 time.
```
./scripts/run.sh \
    $DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/03797390 \
    $DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/mugs_split.json \
    1
```

The next step is to package the data into pkl files for training and testing. Navigate into the `deepmend` directory.
```
cd ..
cd deepmend
```

Run the build script with 4 arguments:
- Path to the directory containing shapenet data
- Path to a .json train/test split file
- Path to a train/test database file (will be created and have _train.pkl or _test.pkl appended)
- Number of breaks

The following: 
```
./scripts/build.sh \
    $DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/03797390 \
    $DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/mugs_split.json \
    $DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/mugs \
    1
```
will create the files `$DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/mugs_train.pkl` and `$DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/mugs_test.pkl`.

This will create two pkl files containing the training and testing data. Now you can train according to the training procedure specified in the parent directory. When creating the `specs.json` file, set the `TrainSplit` and `TestSplit` as the files that were created by the build script:
```
{
    "Description" : "deepmend, mugs dataset",
    "DataSource" : "$DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2",
    "TrainSplit" : "$DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/mugs_train.pkl",
    "TestSplit" : "$DATADIR/ShapeNetCore.v2/mugs_test.pkl",
...
```
